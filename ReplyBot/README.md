ReplyBot
========

22 Apr 2015 - ReplyBot will now auto-clean its database every 10 cycles. It will keep the latest (2 * MAXPOSTS) items, so disk space isn't wasted by comments you'll never see again anyway.

The most basic bot. Searches a subreddit's comments for certain keywords, and replies to the comment if it finds any. You can have multiple keyword triggers, but you only have one reply out-of-the-box.

People ask for these all the time. Be aware of how spammy they can get. If people think your bot is stupid, they will report it. Use ReplyBot as a learning tool, but do not rehash old jokes for the sake of rehashed jokes.
